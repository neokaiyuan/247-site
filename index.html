<p>Support groups need a way to communicate their difficulties and crises and to be supportive of each other when not meeting. Sharing snippets of their stories with each other can help the support process and mitigate feelings of being alone. The use-context would be when at home, away from therapy.</p>

<p>Showoffs need a way to flaunt their skills and knowledge to others of the same community. This encourages friendly competition and encourages people to produce their best work. This communication can come in the form of demonstrating their work in a Facebook-esque geek community, and collaboration on this medium to generate good work. Context would typically be when ideating and working on a project.</p>

<h3>
<a name="3-new-parents" class="anchor" href="#3-new-parents"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. New parents</h3>

<p>Parents need ways to communicate their kids' milestones to their friends and families. While Facebook is a good broadcaster, we envision a place where communities of parents can coexist and share their kids' lives. The main users of this would likely be people who are curious about how they can better raise their children. The use-context would be when they want to share a child's milestone with a select group of friends and family.</p>
